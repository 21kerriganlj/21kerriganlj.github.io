## About Me

Hello -- I am an astronautical engineering student at the University of Southern California and I am interested in engineering analysis. I have 2+ years of project experience through various student design teams, where I have held different leadership roles. Aside from being driven by my interests in physics and mathematics, my mission goal lies in the service of others. Thank you for taking the time to go through my page.
